    <p><br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I started this stock market project in 2015 when I was first figuring out how to use API's and web scrape data. At first it started out as just a small proof of concept project to demonstrate how to web scrape but as I searched for tick data, I realized how abundant real-time stock data was. Using google finances API I wrote python code to web scrape minute tick data from all companies listed on the stock exchange using an HTML fetching function while looping through a pre-generated list of stock tickers so I could get all the data. Organizing the data was the next challenge. </p>
    <div id="Projects"><img src="stockcode.PNG"></div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From the picture snippet one can see that I created a class that would store the name of the stock ticker, the minute data for that day, my own normalized volatility index and the relative ranking of the volatility day to day (plays into another index that I have. Not giving away all of my secrets). The screenshot that is displayed was taken in the early days of development as I have since added many new indicators to the MyClass class.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From my background in physics, the data analysis is very mathematical and has produced fantastic results. I’ve lost my access to a reliable data pool because google finance no longer supports stock data, so this project is currently not active but when it was active I saw very good profits. I could only make 1 trade every day since I didn’t have a pattern day trader account, but with that one trade I would make money 9 times for every 10 times I made a trade. My goal would be to make $50-$100 per profitable trade while keeping my losses to a minimum of $25 when I did see that I had made the wrong choice. From the beginning of my summer 2016 to the end of spring 2017 I made $13,000 roughly. I’m really excited to start up the code again but I really don’t want to spend thousands of dollars for data from some of these companies. I guess if I start making enough money it will be worth it in the long run but we’ll see.</p>
